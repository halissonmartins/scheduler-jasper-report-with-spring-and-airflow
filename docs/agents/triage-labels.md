# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This repo tracks issues as local markdown files (see `issue-tracker.md`), so there are no tracker labels — the role is written as the `Status:` line inside the issue file.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | `Status:` value in our issue files | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`                     | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`                       | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`                  | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`                  | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`                          | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), write the corresponding value on the issue file's `Status:` line.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
